Lists are one of the most fundamental data structures in Python. They're basically just an ordered collection of items. You can think of them like a shopping list - a list of items you need to buy. In Python, a list is denoted by square brackets, like this: ["apple", "banana", "pear"]. You can add, remove, and access items in a list. It's a really powerful data structure that you'll use a lot in Python.
