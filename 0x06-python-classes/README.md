A class is basically a blueprint for an object. It defines what data and methods an object has, and it's used to create new objects. An object is an instance of a class. It has all the data and methods defined by the class, and it can be used to interact with the program. To put it simply, a class is like a cookie cutter, and an object is like the cookie that's made from the cutter.
