Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming in Python. It allows you to create new classes that are based on existing classes. The new class is called the "child" class, and the existing class is called the "parent" class. The child class can inherit all the properties and methods of the parent class, and it can also add its own unique properties and methods. This allows you to build on the functionality of existing classes and create more complex objects.
