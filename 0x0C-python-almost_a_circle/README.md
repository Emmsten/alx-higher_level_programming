Let's start with the concept of "formal arguments". These are the arguments that are defined in the function definition, and they have specific names that are used to access them within the function. "args" and "kwargs" are two special types of formal arguments that can be used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. "args" is a tuple of all the arguments that were passed to the function, while "kwargs" is a dictionary of all the keyword arguments that were passed to the function.
