In Python, an exception is a type of error that can occur when a program is running. Exceptions are raised when something unexpected or abnormal happens in the program, and they can cause the program to terminate if they're not handled properly. The most common types of exceptions in Python are SyntaxError, IndentationError, and NameError. There are also many other specific types of exceptions that can be raised, depending on the situation.
