There are many different types of classes and objects that you can create in Python. In addition to the "string" and "int" classes that we've already discussed, there are also classes for "lists", "dictionaries", "sets", and more. Each of these classes has its own methods and attributes that you can use to manipulate data. Objects are simply instances of a class, which means that they are specific examples of the class. You can think of objects as being like cars, and classes as being like car models.
